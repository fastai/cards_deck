We can create cards like this:\n\nc = Card(suit=1, rank=3)\nc\n\n3♦️\n\n\nIn these docs we’ll generally show the expected output from our code like so:\n\ntest_eq(str(c), '3♦️')\n\n\nc2 = Card(suit=2, rank=11)\ntest_eq(str(c2), 'J❤️')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThese test_eq statements are not just documentation, they are also unit tests! These cells will get tested automatically with continous integration. You can also run tests locally with the command nbdev_test. If you do not want to show a test in your docs, you can choose to hide cells with the #|hide directive.\n\n\n\n\nComparing Cards\nYou can also compare cards like so:\n\ntest_eq(c2 > c, True)"
