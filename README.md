## How to use

Playing cards in python!

d = Deck()
print(f'Number of playing cards in the deck: {len(d)}')
```

    Number of playing cards in the deck: 52

``` python
card = d.pop()
card, len(d)
```

### The `draw_cards` cli:

We included a handy cli you can use to draw cards as well!

    positional arguments:

    optional arguments:

      --replace          whether or not draw with replacement (default: False)
